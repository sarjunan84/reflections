Git requires multiple files commit because one file refers the other files changes to work together.

Git Log files to see the history of commit files

Git Diff file can be used to find the difference between the first and second commit ids.

I can easilty find the commits make my code is not working. I can easily revert to the old version.

For each products and projects we need a workspace. Git for version control and find the commit logs and find the different between two different commits.
